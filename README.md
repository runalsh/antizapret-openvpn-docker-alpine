# antizapret-openvpn-docker-alpine
working, but not completed yet

   disabled BF-CBC, original files from [rootfs.tar.xz](https://antizapret.prostovpn.org/container-images/az-vpn/rootfs.tar.xz)

Need dnsmap replacement for alpine, scripts in /root/dnsmap from original.
May be build from https://github.com/resurrecting-open-source-projects/dnsmap ?
